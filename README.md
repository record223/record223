# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with expertise in building scalable and maintainable web applications. I specialize in Laravel and Vue.js, but I also work with NestJS, Python, and Java. Beyond development, I'm experienced in DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker and setting up robust CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployments.

Over the years, I've gained valuable experience as a Tech Lead, where I have:

- Mentored junior developers and successfully led internship programs, providing structured learning paths and fostering growth within teams.
- Designed and implemented end-to-end solutions tailored to various clients' needs, often working closely with Product Owners (PO) to align technical designs with business goals.
- Played a key role in project estimations, helping companies plan and budget their projects effectively, while balancing technical feasibility and business priorities.

I thrive in SCRUM environments, leveraging agile practices to deliver high-quality products in iterative cycles. My ability to collaborate across cross-functional teams ensures that the solutions I provide are not only technically sound but also aligned with business objectives.

Whether it's guiding a team through a complex architecture or rolling up my sleeves to tackle hands-on coding challenges, I bring a strategic mindset and technical expertise to every project.
